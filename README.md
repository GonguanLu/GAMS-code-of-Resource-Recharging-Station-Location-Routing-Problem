# GAMS-code-of-Resource-Recharging-Station-Location-Routing-Problem
We proposed a resource recharging station location routing problem model based on resource-space-time (RST) network. The model is validated in GAMS. In this GAMS code we used a 5 nodes network (include 2 recharging station node) as instance and transformed it into RST network, then the binary optimization model is built and solved.

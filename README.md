# GAMS-code-of-Resource-Recharging-Station-Location-Routing-Problem
We proposed a resource recharging station location routing problem model based on resource-space-time (RST) network. The model is validated in GAMS. In this GAMS code we firstly transformed the 5 nodes network (include 2 recharging station node) into RST network, then built the model and solved it.
